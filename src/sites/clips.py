"""Animation clips of the site packages, with their targets named.

Doors open, water ripples, a cannon fires: the clips that drive those are ordinary
transform animation, and Unity stores them compiled rather than as editor curves —
the ``m_RotationCurves``/``m_PositionCurves`` lists are all empty and the real data
is one packed clip of streamed, dense and constant curve segments.  This repository
already decodes exactly that format, so the curves are decoded, not skipped.

What a compiled clip does *not* carry is the name of the object each curve drives:
a binding names its target by a hash of the node path.  Those hashes are CRC-32 of
the path string, which is checked rather than assumed — the packages' own node paths
are hashed and matched against the bindings, and a binding whose hash matches no
node in the package keeps the hash and says so instead of being dropped.  The
same one-way rule covers the *property* name: a non-transform binding
addresses a serialized property by a CRC-32 of its name, which is resolved
through the table of observed property names and left as the hash when the
table does not know it.

Curve values are written exactly as the segments store them.  A streamed segment's
keys are cubic coefficients, so they are labelled ``cubic`` and carry all four; a
dense segment is linear samples and a constant segment is one value.  Resampling
them to a fixed frame rate here would bake in a choice the consumer should make.

A clip's *events* are exported as bodies rather than as a count: an event is a
call at a time (the cannon fires one ``PlayEffect`` partway through its clip),
and the count alone says an event exists without saying when it happens or what
it calls, which is the one thing a consumer needs.
