"""Export the standalone action-button icon textures as portable pixels.

These icons are not packed into a sprite atlas.  ``MysekaiActionButtonBase``
resolves an icon file name from the button type and hands it to a texture
loader as ``mysekai/icon/action_icon/<name>``, so each icon is its own bundle
holding a single ``Texture2D`` bound to a ``RawImage``.  The sprite-atlas
exporter cannot see them: it walks ``Sprite`` objects, and there is no
``Sprite`` here.

One PNG per bundle, named after the ``Texture2D``.  The manifest records the
bundle each icon came from together with its declared size, so a consumer can
check the pixels it loaded against the source dimensions.

Do not name the files after the bundle instead: the two disagree in case.
``mysekai/icon/action_icon/icon_action_lostitem_wh`` holds a texture whose
``m_Name`` is ``icon_action_lostItem_wh`` (capital I).  A consumer that derives
the file name by lowercasing the bundle path, or a reader that lowercases the
texture name, loses exactly that one icon and nothing else -- which reads as a
missing asset rather than as a naming assumption.  The manifest carries both
strings per icon so a mismatch is visible instead of inferred.
